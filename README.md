# SpsitNotes

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.0.5.

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
https://github.com/Openlab-Appslab/spsit-notes.git
cd intern-angular
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
npm start
```

The `npm start` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs `lite-server` on port `3000`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
